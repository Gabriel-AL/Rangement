To do :
* correct docker-compose so it works well with node_modules

Flow:
* Connection to multiple accounts
* Load the "likes"
* OnDrag : like on the behalf of an account, unlike from the origin, refresh origin list

To use :
* sortable (multipledrag)

for now I did :
* login on one account, click on the "foin" link, store the code, logout, repeat
* post request on postman
